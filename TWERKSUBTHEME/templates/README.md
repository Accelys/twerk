#TEMPLATES
----------
Drupal 8 provides template files which you can override and modify
by copying them to your sub-theme.

The Twerk theme overrides a handful of Drupal's templates. In order to override
those templates, you should copy them from the `themes/contrib/twerk/templates` folder to your
sub-theme's templates folder.

As always, when adding a new template file to your sub-theme, you will need to
rebuild the "theme registry" in order for Drupal to see it. For more info, see:
